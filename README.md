# React Context Users App

This application belongs to the set of tutorials made with [React](https://es.reactjs.org/).

Made with function components and Hooks. It is an example to learn how to pass properties between child components by using React's **useContext** and **useReducer**. The project structure is a good example to organize in case you have to use different contexts in the application.

This web application shows a list of people's profiles in which selecting one of them shows the details of that profile. For them we make queries through [Axios](https://axios-http.com/es/docs/intro) to the [Reqres](https://reqres.in/) api to obtain fake data from profiles.

We use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library to style the application.

To load them just use:

They will be loaded from package.json dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you must run in a new terminal:
